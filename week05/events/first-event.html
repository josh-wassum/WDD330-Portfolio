    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.
        </li>
        <li>
            An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error
        </li>
        <li>
            An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
        </li>
        <li>
            A warning can occur if thereâ€™s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. 
        </li>
        <li>
            a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: 'use strict';
        </li>
        <li>
            In fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function
        </li>
        <li>
            I love my linting tool!
        </li>
        <li>
            The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
            An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function
        </li>
        <li>
            I use error functions often when writing code.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have used Jest for awhile now and I can't live without it.
        </li>
