                What is your opinion of functional programing and the use of pure functions? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there a reason we did the TODO application before learning AJAX?
            </li>
            <li>
                I have done backend 2 and in it we used node.js and I feel like we used callbacks all of the time. What are some things you 
                have implemented to avoid "callback hell"?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there ever a time we would use pure javascript for working ajax, or are we more likely to see node.js, or angular.js or any of the other frameworks?
