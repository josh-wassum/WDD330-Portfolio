    <h1>Chapter 13: AJAX</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The use of Ajax revolutionized how websites worked, and ushered in a new age of web applications. Web pages were no longer static, but dynamic applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.
        </li>
        <li>
            JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses.
        </li>
        <li>
            Although most of the time you will be dealing with a response object that is returned from a request you make, you can also create your own response objects using a constructor function
        </li>
        <li>
            The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Fetch API is, at the time of writing, what is known as a 'living standard', which means that the specification is being developed 'in the wild'. This means that, despite it being available to use, itâ€™s still subject to change as developers, browser vendors and end-users provide feedback about how it works. 
        </li>
