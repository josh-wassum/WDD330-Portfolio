    <h1>Chapter 8: CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Transforms don’t work on inline elements. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first.
        </li>
        <li>
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
        </li>
        <li>
            The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.
        </li>
        <li>
            As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property.
        </li>
        <li>
            The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis.
        </li>
        <li>
            The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.
        </li>
        <li>
            The lack of powerful processors on many mobile devices makes CSS animations a great alternative to weighty, CPU-intensive JavaScript animation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not quote the animation name.
        </li>
        <li>
            
        </li>
    </ul>
