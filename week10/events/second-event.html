    <h1>MDN: Using Fetch</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
        </li>
        <li>
            basic fetch request: 
            fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data));
        </li>
        <li>
            I have used fetch quite a bit in backend 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included on both same-origin and cross-origin calls, add credentials: 'include' to the init object you pass to the fetch() method.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you only want to send credentials if the request URL is on the same origin as the calling script, add credentials: 'same-origin'.
        </li>
        <li>
            We are able to upload multiple JSON files using the fetch api.
        </li>
        <li>
            A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side, although this usually means permission issues or similar â€” a 404 does not constitute a network error, for example.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can supply your own request object using the Fetch API.
        </li>
        <li>
            
        </li>
