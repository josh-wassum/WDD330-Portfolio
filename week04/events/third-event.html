    <h1>Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript</h1>

    <h2>Modular JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules</li>
        <li>For a long time, JavaScript didn't support modules, but native support for them was finally added in ES6. They allow you to keep parts of code in self-contained files.</li>
        <li>Did the practice code, not a long section so not a lot of notes.</li>
    </ul>
